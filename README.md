# libasm

My first project in assembly language. The task is to write some library functions for working with strings in assembly language.
Analogs of the following functions are implemented:
* [read](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html)
* [strcmp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strcmp.3.html)
* [strcpy](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strcpy.3.html)
* [strdup](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strdup.3.html)
* [strlen](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strlen.3.html)
* [write](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html)
